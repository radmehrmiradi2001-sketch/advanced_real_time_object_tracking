Advanced Real-Time Object Tracking

A real-time object tracking system built with OpenCV and NumPy. This project demonstrates how to detect and track objects frame by frame using classical tracking algorithms, providing a lightweight alternative to deep learning‚Äìbased trackers.

‚∏ª

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Real-time object tracking from webcam or video file.
	‚Ä¢	Multiple tracker support (e.g., KCF, CSRT, MOSSE depending on OpenCV build).
	‚Ä¢	ROI (Region of Interest) selection for initializing the tracker.
	‚Ä¢	Frame-by-frame visualization with bounding boxes.
	‚Ä¢	Minimal dependencies (NumPy + OpenCV).

üöÄ Quick start

# 1) Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install deps
pip install -U pip
pip install numpy opencv-python

# 3) Run object tracker with webcam
python advanced_real_time_object_tracking.py --source 0

# 4) Or track objects in a video file
python advanced_real_time_object_tracking.py --source path/to/video.mp4

During the first run, select a region of interest (ROI) with your mouse. The tracker will then follow the selected object across frames.

‚öôÔ∏è CLI usage

python advanced_real_time_object_tracking.py \
  --source <path_or_index>   # video path or webcam index (default: 0) \
  --tracker <name>           # tracking algorithm (default: CSRT)

Example:

python advanced_real_time_object_tracking.py --source video.mp4 --tracker KCF

üõ†Ô∏è Supported trackers

Depending on your OpenCV build:
	‚Ä¢	CSRT ‚Äì accurate, slower.
	‚Ä¢	KCF ‚Äì fast, robust for simple cases.
	‚Ä¢	MOSSE ‚Äì very fast, less accurate.
	‚Ä¢	MIL, TLD, MedianFlow, Boosting ‚Äì other classical options.

üì¶ Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Python ‚â• 3.8
	‚Ä¢	numpy
	‚Ä¢	opencv-python

Example requirements.txt:

numpy>=1.24
opencv-python>=4.8


‚∏ª

üß≠ Tips
	‚Ä¢	For best results, choose a clear and well-defined ROI.
	‚Ä¢	Use CSRT for accuracy, MOSSE for speed.
	‚Ä¢	Works best on stable lighting and minimal motion blur.
	‚Ä¢	Tracking may fail under occlusion ‚Äî reselect ROI if needed.

‚∏ª

üß± Roadmap (ideas)
	‚Ä¢	Add multi-object tracking support.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate deep learning‚Äìbased object detectors for auto-initialization.
	‚Ä¢	Save output video with tracked bounding boxes.
	‚Ä¢	Benchmark tracker performance.

‚∏ª

üôå Acknowledgments
	‚Ä¢	Built with OpenCV‚Äôs tracking API.
	‚Ä¢	Inspired by classical CV approaches for lightweight, real-time applications.
